        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Brisket </li>
                <li> 1 tbsp brown sugar </li>
                <li> 2 tsp paprika powder</li>
                <li> 1 tsp onion powder </li>
                <li> 1 tsp garlic powder </li>
                <li> 1/2 tsp cumin powder </li>
                <li> 3/4 tsp mustard powder </li>
                <li> 1 tsp salt </li>
                <li> 1/2 tsp black pepper </li>
              
        <h2> Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Mix Rub ingredients. Rub all over brisket. If time permits, leave for 30 minutes – 24 hours in the fridge, but I rarely do this. </li>
                <li> Combine BBQ Sauce ingredients in a slow cooker. Mix then add the brisket – squish it in if needed, like I did (see video). </li>
                <li> Slow cook in slow cooker for 8 hours (1.5 kg / 3 lb) to 10 hours (2 kg / 4 lb). (Note 2 for pressure cooker and click here for oven) </li>
                <li>  Remove brisket onto a tray. </li>
                <li> Pour liquid in slow cooker into a saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium high heat and reduce until it thickens to a syrup consistency (it thickens more as it cools).</li>
                <li>  Meanwhile, drizzle brisket with oil then roast in a 200C/390F oven for 15 minutes until brown spots appear. Remove then baste generously with Sauce, then return to oven for 5 minutes. Remove and baste again, then return to oven for 5 – 10 minutes until it caramelises and looks like the photos. (See note for BBQ option)</li>
                <li>  TO SERVE: Slice brisket thinly across the grain and serve with remaining BBQ Sauce. This is terrific served as a meal with sides or piled high onto rolls with Coleslaw as sliders. See Note 3 for more ideas. </li>
            </ol>            
            </ul>
